 * Adds a stream to the published lineup.

 * Admin only, and the stricter of the two reasons is not authorisation but
 * blast radius: a channel added here appears for every viewer, and it also
 * makes Jellyfin re-enumerate its tuner.
 *
 * The new channel does NOT appear in Streamy immediately. Jellyfin caches its
 * channel list and only picks up a lineup change on its next refresh, which is
 * why the response says so rather than letting the panel imply otherwise --
 * "I added it and nothing happened" is the obvious next report if it does not.
